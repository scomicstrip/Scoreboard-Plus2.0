# Scoreboard+ 2.0
<h1>Remake of Scoreboard+</h1>

<p>Scoreboard+ 1.0 was an interesting program I made, during my free time, that wasn't going to be released to the public. I have now seen people using this software around the world and I realized my code needed to be rewritten from the scratch. I have realized there were too many bugs and glitches that were unfixable unless I created a freshly written code. This is the rewritten code that has not been finished for a while, due to how busy my life has became, and required to be developed. If anyone wants to contribute to this project I would really appreciate it and gladly help with anything. For now I will not be working on this project until I have time</p>

<h1>Things I want to be put in to Scoreboard+ 2.0. Including people's suggetions:</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Fully featured built in remote</li>
  <li>Ability to customize your scoreboard layout</li>
  <li>Make a scoreboard that can be projected up to a TV/Screen</li>
  <li>Make a scoreboard that can be projected up to OBS</li>
  <li>Add animation to the scoreboard</li>
  <li>Fix all the common bugs and glitches that are in the Scoreboard+ 1.X</li>
  </ul>
